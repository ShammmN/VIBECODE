Deployment Documentation for Flower Catcher üíê Game
Introduction
This document outlines the steps required to deploy the "Flower Catcher üíê" game to the web. In this game, players catch flowers falling from the top of the screen within 60 seconds, with a specific flower to catch for each round. The game also includes soothing background music, and the player collects a "bouquet" of flowers, which includes the correct flowers, bombs (dead flowers), and other collected items.

Game Overview
Objective: The player must catch the specified flower (target flower) that appears in the HUD. The goal is to catch as many correct flowers as possible within 60 seconds.

Gameplay:

Flowers fall from the top of the screen, and you control a basket at the bottom to catch them by moving left or right using the arrow keys.

Catching a correct flower increases your score, while catching a bomb (üí£) results in a "dead flower" (ü•Ä), which reduces your score. Catching an incorrect flower reduces your score as well. 

After the game ends, the player sees a final bouquet with all the flowers they collected during the game including dead flowers. 

Background music (a calming tune) plays throughout the game.
