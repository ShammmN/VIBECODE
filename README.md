What did you build?
 I built a relaxing game which you collect flowers that are dropping from the top of the screen. 
 You have one main flower to catch which increases your score. The game goes on for 60 seconds and plays relaxing music.
 At the end of the game the system displays a bouquet of the correct flowers you collected along with dead flowers which are the bombs. 
 
 What language(s) or tools did you use?
 The languages I used were JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to build this game.
 
 Which AI tools did you use, and how?
 The AI tools I used was ChatGPT to write my code based on my idea for the game and slowly add touch ups and new features along the way. 
 
 What did you do versus what AI helped with?
 I came up with the game idea and added the music feature. While ChatGPT coded the whole gameplay, as in most of the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML code.
 
 What’s one thing you’re proud of?
 I am proud of the aesthetic and how the flowers look. I also like the overall idea of the game and the extra little features like the timer, play buttons, and music.
 
 What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?
 One thing I could improve is I could make it more competitive by keeping tracking of the users high score. 
 I could also fix what the bouquet outputs to make it output a real picture of the target flower as a bouquet.
